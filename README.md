## Installation
No previous installations is required to use the engine, just download and execute the .exe file *GATE_Engine* from releases.

## Camera Controls
### Mouse
* MiddleButtonClickDrag: Move the camera in the plane of the camera frame.
* MouseWheel: Move camera forwards of backwards.
* LeftClickDrag: Move the camera in the plane of the camera frame.
* RightClickDrag: Rotate on itself.
* Left Alt + LeftClickDrag: Rotate around reference point.
* Left Alt + RightClickDrag: Move camera forwards of backwards.

### Keyboard
* RightMouseClick + W/S, A/D, Q/E: Move camera forwards, backwards, sideways, and vertically.
* Movement + MouseWheel: Increase or decrease camera speed.
* Up/Down, Left/Right Arrows: Move camera forwards, backwards, and sideways.
* Shift + Movement: Boost camera speed (multiplier).
